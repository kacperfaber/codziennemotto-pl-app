## Configuration
The app actually uses only two configuration values
* **Profile** - When it's developer, we have some developer tools active.
* **ApiUrl** - URL when codziennemotto.pl API running. See [api](https://www.github.com/kacperfaber/codziennemotto_pl_server)

```js
// I'm using webpack-define-plugin to put this configuration variables into build.
// If you want to edit this, please see webpack.config.{profile}.js
// where {profile} is your active profile.
// for exmaple 'npm run run-dev' will work as developer.

new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    "process.env.PROFILE": JSON.stringify("dev"),
    "process.env.CONFIG": JSON.stringify({apiUrl: "http://localhost:8080"})
})
```
